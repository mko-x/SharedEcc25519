	- removed the last few instances of data-dependent branching outside 
	  the signer-private-key generation.

200608241654
	- all code seems to work now, passes fairly rigorous tests
	- improved benchmark and self-test code
	- describe EC-KCDSA in header file

200608232244
	- fixed bugs in sign-key generation and signing
	- initial implementation of verify, doesn't work yet

200608222100
	- now fixed timing again for everything except generating a private 
	  key for signing, and that'll do for me.
	- implemented sign (not yet tested)

200508221644
	- made divmod fixed-timing (depending only on size of arguments)
	- confirmed egcd makes curve25519 noticably vary in timing;  need to 
	  find alternate solution, one which works for mod-p and mod-q
	- further improved benchmark code

200608221049
	- revised API, now including signing (not yet implemented)
	- faster field division using egcd
	- signer key generation implemented (not fully tested)

200608191518
	- simplified exported interface
	- more cleanly structured curve25519 code
	- simpler benchmarking and self-test code

200608182153
	- merged montgomery25519 into point25519
	- removed remaining data-dependent branches
	- improved benchmarking and self-test code

200608181633
	- fixed bug in pack25519
	- optionally also output (n+1)P from point25519
	- documentation fixes
	- slightly cleaned up code of montgomery25519

200608180214
	- initial release
